This is a repo demonstrating how to leverage zk-snarks and ethereum for trustlessly selling:

1. private keys of ethereum addresses
2. eddsa signatures
3. groth16 proofs

You can read our post [here](https://www.privatemarket.dev/whatisthis). Or see [Private Market](https://www.privatemarket.dev) in action. We deployed the contracts to the Sepolia testnet.
